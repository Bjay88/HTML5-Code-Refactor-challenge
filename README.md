# Html-CSS-challenge

## Description

This project is a challenge to test code refactoring and how to build and modify a client or company's website and still achieve the end user satisfaction and employers testability.

This created a short code sequence thereby achieving same results and I also learned more about CSS attributes and elements identification.
